# Mastering Java For Beginners
This repository includes Java Core Course Materials for [Mastering Java For Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/3554715/learn/lecture/22985404/?instructorPreviewMode=student_v4#content)  

## Why Java?
Currently, Java is the 2<sup>nd</sup> most popular Programming language according to [PYPL](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html). 

Java has wide variety of applications including but not limited to;
  * Web development
  * Banking
  * Financial Services
  * Big Data
  * Android Application

As a result, it can be said that java is a trending topic.
